U.S.  RELATIONS  W!TH  THE  USSR
U.S.  policy  toward  the  Soviet  Union  will  consist of  three
elements:  external  resistance  to· soviet ·imperialism;  internal,
pressure  on  the  USSR to  weaken  ~h0-wS  1  im  erialism;
and  negotiations  to  eliminate,  on  the  basis  of  strict reciprocity,
6utstandi n  disa  reements.  Specifically,  U.S.  tasks  are:
1.  To  contain  and  over  time  reverse  Soviet  expansionism  by
competing  effectively on  a  sustained  basis  with  the  Soviet
Union  in  all international  arenas--. particularly  in  the
overall military  balance  and  in  geographical  regions  of
priority concern  to  the  United  States.  This  will  remain
the  primary  focus  of  U.S.  policy  toward ·the  USSR.
2.  To  promote,  within  the  narrow  limits  available  to us,  the
process  of  change  in  the  Soviet  Union  toward  a  more  plura
listic political  and  economic  system  in which  the  power  of
the  privileged  ruling  elite  is gradually  reduced.  The  U.S.
recognizes  that  Soviet  aggressiveness  has  deep  roots  in  the
internal  system,  and  that  relations  with  the  USSR  should
therefore  take  into  account  whether  or  not  they  help  to
strengthen  this  system  and  its capacity  to  engage  in
aggression.
3.  To  engage  the  Soviet  Union  in  negotiations .to  attempt  to
reach  agreements  which  protect  and  enhance  U.S.  interests
and  which  are  consistent with  the  principle of  strict
reciprocity  and  mutual  interest.  This  is  important  when
the  Soviet  Union  is in  the midst  of  a  process  of  political
succession.  ~ -
In  order  to  implement  this  threefold  strategy,  the  U.S.  must  convey
clearly to  Moscow  that unacceptable  behavior  will  incur  costs  that
would  outweigh  any  gains.  At  the  same  time,  the  U.S.  must  make
clear- "to· lne . Soviets  that genuine  restraint  in  their behavior
would  create ·the  possibility of  an  East~we.?  t-re.l a~t ·-i-onship  that
might  bring  important  benefits  fo~  the  Soviet  Union.  It is  .
- particularly  important  that  this message  be  convey~d  clearly during
the  succession  period,  since  this may  be  a  particularly opportune
time  for  external  forces  to  affect  the  policies of  Brezhnev's
successors.

Shaping  the  Soviet  Environment:  Arenas  of  Engagement
Implementation  of  U.S.  policy must  focus  on  shaping  the  environment
in which  Soviet  decisions  are made  both  in  a  wide  variety of
functional  and  ~~~litical arenas  and  in  the  u.s.-soviet  bilateral
relationship.
~
A.  Functional
1.  Military  Strategy:  The  U.S.  must  mo9ernize  its military
forces  -- both nuclear  and  conventional  -- so  that  Soviet  leaders
perceive  that  the  U.S.  is determined  never  to  accept  a  second
place  or  a  deteriorating military posture.  ·soviet  calculations
of  possible  war  outcomes  under  any  contingency must  always  result
in  outcomes  so  unfavorable  to  the  USSR  that  there  would  be  no
incentive  for  Soviet  leaders  to  initiate  an  attack.  The  future
strength of  U.S.  military capabilities must  be  assured.  U.S.
military technology  advances  musrt  b e  exploited,  while  controls
over  transfer  of military related/dual-use  technology,  products,
and  services  must  be  tightened.
In  Europe,  the  Soviets  must  be  faced  with  a  reinvigorated  NATO.
In  the  Far  East  we  must  ensure  that the  Soviets  cannot  count  on  a
secure  flank  in  a  global  war.  Worldwide,  U.S.  general  purpose
forces  must  be  strong  and  flexible  enough  to  affect  Soviet
calculations  in  a  wide  variety of  contingencies.  In  the  Third
World,  Moscow  must  know  that  areas  of  interest  to  the  U.S.  cannot
be  attacked  or  threatened  without  risk of  serious  U.S.  military
),21'.
countermeasures.
2.  Economic  Policy:  U.S.  policy  on  economic  relations  with  the
USSR  must  serve  strategic  and  foreign  policy  goals  as  well  as
economic  interests.  In  this  context,  U.S.  objectives  are:
Above  all,  to  ensure  that  East-West  economic  relations  do
not  facilitate  the  Soviet military  buildup.  This  requires
prevention  of  the  transfer  of  technology  and  equipment  that
would  make  a  substantial contribution directly or  indirectly
to  Soviet military power.
To  avoid  subsidizing  the  Soviet  economy  or  unduly  easing  the
burden  of  Soviet  resource  allocation decisions,  so  as  not  to
dilute  pressures  for  structural  change  in  the  Soviet  system.
To  seek  to minimize  the  potential  for  Soviet  exercise  of
-reve~se -leverage  on  Western  countries  based  on  trade,  energy
supply,  .and  financial  relationships . ....  -..  -· .
4';_:-::

sidization or  the  creation  of  Western  dependence  -- with  the

~
SENSITIVE</ns0:p>
        <ns0:pb n="4"/>
        <ns0:p>SENSITIVE  3
The  U.S.  must  exercise  strong ·leadership  with  its Allies  and
others  to  develop  a  common _understanding  of. the  strategic  implica
tions  of  East-West  trade,  building  upon  the  agreement  announced
November  13,  1982  (see  NSDD  66).  This  approach  should  involve
efforts  to  reach  agreements  with  the  Allies  on  specific measures,
such  as:  (a)  no  incremental  deliveries  of  Soviet  gas  beyond  the
amounts  contracted  for  from  the  first  strand  of  the  Siberian
pipeline;  (b)  the  addition  of_ critical technologies  and  equipment
to  the  COCOM  list,  the harmonization  of  national  licensing
procedures  for  COCOM,  and  the  substantial  improvement  of  the
coordination  and  effectiveness  of  international  enforcement
efforts;  (t)  controls .on  advanced  technology  and  equipment  beyond
the  expanded  COCOM  list,  including  equipment  in  the  oil  and  gas
sector;  (d)  further  restraints on  officially-backed  credits  such
as  higher  down  payments,  shortened maturities  and  an  established
framework  to monitor  this  process;  and  (e)  .the  strengthening  of
the  role O~ •the  OECD  and  NATO  in  East-West  trade  analysis  and
policy.  ~)  .
In  the  longer  term,  if  Soviet  behavior  should  worsen,  e.g.,  an
invasion  of  Poland,  we  would  need  to  consider  extreme measures.
Should  Soviet  behavior  improve,  carefully calibrated positive
economic  signals, -including  a  broadening  of  government-to-government
economic  contacts,  could  be  considered  as  a  means  of  demonstrating
to  the  Soviets  the  benefits  that  real  restraint  in  their conduct.
might  bring.  Such  steps  co~~ot,  hpwever,  alter  the  basic
direction of  U.S.  policy.  /''  ·  '
3.  Political Action:  U.S.  policy must .have  an  ideological
thrust which  clearly affirms  the  superiority of  U.S.  and  Western
values  of  individual dignity  and  freedom,  a  free  press,  free
trade  unions,  free  enterprise,  and  political democracy  over  the
repressive  features  of  Soviet  Communism.  We  need  to  review and
significantly  strengthen  U.S.  instruments  of  political  action
including:  (a)  The  President's  London  initiative to  support
democratic  forces;  (b)  USG  efforts  to  highlight  Soviet  human
rights  violations;  and  (c)  U.S.  radio  broadcasting  policy.  The
U.S.  should:
Expose  at  all available  fora  the  double  standards  employed
by  the  Soviet  Union  in  dealing  with  difficulties within  its
own ·domain  and  the  outside  ("capitalist")  world  (e.g.,
treatment  of  labor,  policies  toward  ethnic  minorities,  use
of  chemical  weapons,  etc.).
Preyent  the  Soviet  propaganda machine  from  seizing  the
semantic high-ground  in  the  battle  of_i dea_s ~t:.prough  the
appropriation  of  such  terms  as  "pe'ace·. ~•·  ~ ,..
Geopolitical
1.  The  Industrial  Democracies:  An  effective  response  to  the
Soviet  challenge  requires  close  partnership  among  the  industrial
democracies,  including  stronger  and  more  effective  collective
defense  arrangements~  The  U.S.  must  p~ovide  strong  leadership

and  conduct  effective  consultations  to  build  consensus  and
cushion  the  impact  of  intra-alliance disagreements.  While  Allied
support  of  U.S.  overall  strategy  is essential,  the  U.S.  may  on
occasion  be  forced  to  act  to  protect vital  interests without
Allied  support  and  even  in  the  face  of  Allied  opposition;  even  in
this  event,  however,  U.S. Y~.. 2 h' ~ol d .c onsult  to  the maximum  extent
possible with  its Allies.
2.  The  Third  World:  The  U.S.  must  rebuild  the  credibility of
its commitment  to  resist Soviet  encroachment. on  U.S.  interests
and  those  of  its Allies  and  friends,  and  to  support  effectively
those  Third  World  states that  are  willing  to  resist Soviet  pressures
or  oppose  Soviet  initiatives hostile to  the •United  States,  or  are
special  targets  of  Soviet  policy.  The  U.S.  effort  in the  Third
World  must  involve  an  important  role  for  security assistance  and
foreign military  sales,  as  well  as  readiness  to  use  U.S.  military
forces  where  necessary  to  protect vital  interests  and  support
endangered  Allies  and  friends.  U.S.  policy must  also  involve
diplomatic  initiatives to  promote  resolution  of  regional  crises
vulnerable  to  Soviet  exploitation,  and  an  appropriate mixture  of
economic  assistance  programs  and  private  sector  initiatives  for
Third  World  countries.  ~ )"
3.  The  Soviet  Empire:  There  are  a  number  of  important  weaknesses
and  vulnerabilities  within  the  Soviet  empire  which  the  U.S.
should  exploit.  U.S.  policies  should  seek  wherever  possible  to
encourage  Soviet  allies  to  distance.themselves  from  Moscow  in
foreign  policy  and  to move  toward  democratization domestically.
(9)
✓
(a)  Eastern  Europe:  The  primary  U.S.  objective  in Eastern
Europe  is  to  loosen  Moscow's  hold  on  the  region while  promoting
the  cause  of  human  rights  in  individual  East  European  countries.
The  U.S.  can  advance  this objective  by  carefully ·discriminating
in  favor  of  countries  that  show  relative  independence  from
the  USSR  in their  foreign  policy,  or  show  a  greater degree
of  internal  liberalization.  U.S.  policies must  also make
clear that  East  European  countries which  reverse movements
of  liberalization,  or drift  away  from  an  independent  stance
in  foreign  policy,  will  incu·r  significant  costs  in their
ft}
relations  with  the  U.S.
(b)  Afghanistan:  The  U.S.  objective  is  to  keep  maximum  pressure
on  Moscow  for  withdrawal  and  to  ensure  that  the  Soviets'
politic al,  military.,  and. ..,..9ther  costs  remain  high  while  the
occ~pation  continues.  ---("'S)
- -·· - .........  .
(c)  Cuba:  The  u. S.  must  take  strong count. er. me. as~ u-:~r  es  to  affect
the  political/military  impact  of  Soviet  arms  deliveries  to
Cuba.  The  U.S.  must  also  provide ·economic  and  military
assistance  to  states  in Central  America  and  the  Caribbean
Basin  threatened  by  Cuban  destabilizing  activities.  Finally,
the  U.S.  will  seek  to  reduce  the  Cuban  presence  and  influence
in  southern  Africa  by  energetic  leadership  of  the  diplomatic
effort  to  achieve  a  Cuban  withdrawal  from  Angola,  or  failing
that,  by  i_9.Creasing  the  costs  of  Cuba's  role  in  southern

(d)  Soviet  Third  World  Alliances:  U.S.  poiicy will  seek  to  limit
the  destabilizing  activities of  Soviet  Third  World  allies
and  clients.  It is  a  further  objective  to  weaken  and,  where
possible,  undermine  the  existing  links  between  them  and  the
Soviet  Union.  U.S.  policy will  include  active  efforts .to
encourage  democratic  movements  and  forces  to  bring  about
political  change  inside  these  countries.  {;,(
4.  China:  China  continues  to  support  U.S.  efforts  to  strengthen
the world's  defenses  against  Soviet  expansionism.  The  U.S.
should  over  time  seek  to  achieve  enhanced  strategic  cooperation
and  policy  coordination with  China,  and  to  reduce  the  possibility
of  a  Sino-Soviet  rapprochement.  The  U.S.  will  continue  to  pursue
a  policy of  substantially  liberalized  technology  transfer  and
sale of  military equipment  to China  on  a  case-by-case  basis
within  the ·parameters  of  the  policy ~~oved  by  the  President  in
y,  .  ·
1981,  and  defined  further  in  1982.
5.  Yugoslavia:  Itis U.S.  policy to  support  the  independence,
territorial  integrity and  national  uni_ty of  Yugoslavia.  Yugoslavia's
current  difficulties  in paying  its foreign  debts  have  increased
its vulnerability to  Soviet  pressures.  T_he  Yugoslav  government,
well  aware  of  this vulnerability,  would  like  to  reduce  its trade
dependence  on  the  Soviet  Union.  It is .in our  interest to  prevent
any deterioriation  in  Yugoslavia's  economic  situatioyhat might
weaken  its resolve  to  withstand  Soviet  pressure.
~
c.  Bilaterial  Relationships
1.  Arms  Control:  The  U.S.  will  enter  into  arms  control  negotiations
when  they  serve  U.S.  national  security objectives.  At  the  same
time,  U.S.  policy  recognizes  that  arms  con~rol  agreements  are  not
an .end  in  themselves  but  are,  in  combinatiqn  with  U.S.  and  Allied
efforts  to maintain  the military  balance,  an  important means  for
enhancing  national  security  and  global  stability.  The  U.S.
should make  clear  to  the Allies  as  well  as  to  the  USSR  that  U.S.
ability to  reach  satisfactory results  in  arms  control  negotiations
will  inevitably  be  influenced  by  the  international  situation,  the
overall  state of  u.s.-soviet relations,  and  the  difficulties  in
defining  areas  of mutual  agreement  with  an  adversary  which  often
seeks  unilateral gains.  U.S.  ·arms  control  proposals  will  be
consistent  with  necessary  force  modernization  plans  and  will  seek
to  achieve  balanced,  significant,  and  verifiable  reductions  to

also  be  useful  in driving  home  to  Moscow  that the  costs  of
irresponsibility are  high, ·and  that  the  U. s·.  is prepared  to work
for  pr.agmatic  solutions  of  regional  problems  if Moscow  is willing
seriously to  address  U.S.  concerns.  At  the  same  time,  such
contacts must  be  handled  with  care  to  avoid  offering  the  Soviet
_j.fo{.
Union  a  role  in  regional  questions  it would  not  otherwise  secure.
A continuing dialogue  with  the  Soviets  at  Foreign  Minister
level  facilitates  necessary  diplomatic  communication  with  the
Soviet  leadership  and  helps  to maintain  Allied  understanding  and
support  for  U.S.  approach  to  East-West  relations.  A  summit
between  President  Reagan  and  his  Soviet  counterpart might  promise
similarly beneficial  results.  At  the  same  time,  unless  it were
carefully handled  a  summit  could  be  seen  as  registering  an  improve
ment  in  u.s.-soviet  relations  without  the  changes  in  Soviet
behavior  which  we  have  insisted upon.  It could  therefore generate
unrealizable  expectations  and  yurther  stimulate  unilateral Allied
initiatives  toward  Moscow.
~
A summit  would  not  necessarily  involve  signature  of maj·or
new  U.S.-Soviet  agreements.  Any  summit  meeting  should  achieve
the  maximum  possible  positive  impact  with  U.S.  Allies  and  the
American  public,  while  making  clear  to  both  audiences  that  improve
ment  in  Soviet-American  relations  depends  on  changes  in  Soviet
conduct.  A summit  without.s¢h  changes  must  not  be  understood  to
signal  such  improvement.  ;,z&gt;  ·
3.  U.S.-Soviet  Cooperative  Exchanges:  The  role  of  U.S.-Soviet
cultural,  educational,  scientific and  other  cooperative  exchanges
should  be  seen  in  light of  the  U.S.  intention  to maintain  a  strong
ideological  component  in  relations  with  Moscow.  The  U.S.  should
not  further  dismantle  the  framework  of  exchanges;  indeed  those
exchanges  which  could  advance  the  U.S.  objective  of  promoting
positive  evolutionary  change  within  the  Soviet  system  should  be
expanded.  At  the  same  time,  the  U.S.  will  insist ·on  full
reciprocity  and  encourage  its Allies  to  do  so  as  well~his
recognizes  that unless  the  U. ·s.  has  an  effective official  frame
work  for  handling  exchanges,  the  Soviets  will make  separate
arrangements  with  private  U.S.  sponsors,  while  denying  reciprocal
access  to  the  Soviet  Union.  U.S.  policy  on  exchanges  must  also
take  into  account  the  necessity  to  pre~~ transfer  of  sensitive
U.S.  technology  to  the  Soviet  Union.  ~)

The  uncertainties  will  be  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  the  Soviet
Union  will  be  engaged  in  the  unpredictable  process  of  political
succession  to  Brezhnev.  The  U.S~  will  not  seek  to  adjust  its
policies  to  the  Soviet  internal  conflict,  but  rather  try  to
create  incentives  (positive  and. negative)  for  the  new  leadership
to  adopt  policies  less  detrimental  to  U.S.  interests.  The  U.S.
will  remain  ready  for  improved  u.s.-soviet  relations  if the
Soviet  Union  makes  significant changes  in  policies  of  concern  to
it;  the  burden  for  any  further  deterioration  in  relations must
fall  squarely  on  Moscow . .  yhe  U.S.  must  not  yield  to  pressures  to
"take  the  first  step."  ~
The  existing  and  projected  gap  between  finite  U.S.  resources  and
the  level  of  capabilities needed  to  implement  U.S.  strategy makes
it essential  that  the  U.S.:  (1)  establish  firm  priorities  for
the  use  of  limited  U.S.  resources  where  they  will  have  the  greatest
restraining  impact  on  the  Soviet  Union;  and  (2)  mobilize  the
resources  of Allies  and  friends  which  are  willing  to  j6in the
j,Z)
U.S.  in  containing  the  expansion  of  Soviet.power.
Underlying  the  full  range  of  U.S.  and  Western  policies must  be  a
strong military  capable  of  action  across  the  entire  spectrum  of
potential  conflicts  and  guided  by  a  well  conceived  political and
military  strategy.  The  heart  of  U.S.  military  strategy  is to  deter
attack  by  the  USSR  and  its allies aga_inst the  U.S.,  its Allies,
or  other  important  countries,  and  to  defeat  such  an  attack  should
deterrence  fail.  Although  unilateral  U.S.  efforts must  lead  the
way  in  rebuilding  Western  military  strength  to  counter  the  Soviet
threat,  the  protection of  Western  interests  will  require  increased
u.s.· cooperation  with Allied  and  other  states  and  greater  utili
zation of  their  resources.  This  military  strategy will  be  combined
with  a  political  strategy  attaching  high  priority to  the  following
objectives:
Sustaining  steady,  long-term  growth  in  U.S.  defense  spending
and  capabilities  -- both  nuclear  and  conventional.  This  is
the  most  important  way  of  conveying  to  the  Soviets  U.S.
resolve  and  political  staying-power.
Creating  a  long-term Western  consensus  for  dealing  with  the
Soviet  Union.  This  will  require  that  the  U.S.  exercise
strong  leadership  in  developing  policies  to  deal  with  the
multifaceted  Soviet  threat  to  Western  interests.  It will
require  that  the  U.S.  take  Allied  concerns. into  account,  and
also  that  U.S.  Allies  take  into  equal  account  U.S.  concerns.
-:In

to  negotiate  arms  contrql  ag+eements  consistent with  U.S.
military  strategy  and  necessary  force  modernization  plans,
and  should  seek  to  achieve  balanced,  sigificant  and  verifiable
reductions  to  equal  levels  of  comparable  armaments.  The
U.S.  must  also  develop,  together  with  the  Allies,  a  unified
Western  approach  to  East-West  economic  relations,  implementing
the  agreement  announced  on  November  13,  1982.

Maintenance  of  a  strategic  relationship with  China,  and
efforts  to  minimize  opportunities ·for  a· Sino-soviet
rapprochement.
Building and  sustaining a  major  ideological/political
offensive  which,  together· with  other  efforts,  will  be
designed  to  bring  about  evolutionary  change  of  the  Soviet
system.  This  must- be  a  long-term  and  sophisticated program,
given  the  nature  of  the  Soviet  system.
Effective  opposition  to  Moscow's  efforts  to  consolidate  its
position  in  Afghanistan.  This  will  require  that  the  U.S.
continue  efforts  to  promote  Soviet  withdrawal  in the  context
of  a  negotiated  settlement  of  the  conflict.  At  the  same
time,  the  U.S.  must  keep  pressure  on  Moscow  for  withdrawal
and  ensure  that  Soviet  costs  on  the  ground  are  high.
Blocking  the  expansion  of  Soviet  influence  in  the  critical
Middle  East  and  Southwest  Asia  regions.  This  will  require
both  continued  efforts  to  seek  a  political  solution  to  the
Arab-Israeli  conflict and  to  bolster  U.S.  relations  with
moderate  states  in  the  region,  and  a  sustained  U.S.  defense
commitment  to  deter  Soviet  military encroachments.
Maintenance  of  international  pressure  on  Moscow  to  permit
a  relaxation  of .the  current  repression  in  Poland  and  a
longer-term  increase  in diversity and  independence  through
out  Eastern  Europe.  This  will  require  that  the  U.S.  continue
to  impose  costs on  the  Soviet  Union  for  its behavior  in
Poland.  It will  also  require  that  the  U.S.  maintain  a  U.S.
policy  of  differentiation  among  East  European  countries.
Neutralization  and  reduction  of  the  threat  to  U.S.  national
security  interests  posed  by  the  Soviet-Cuban  relati•onship.
This  will  require  that  the  U.S.  use  a  variety of  instruments, .
including diplomatic  efforts  and  U.S.  security  and  economic
assistance.  The  U.S.  must  also  retain  the  option  of  using
of  its military  forces  to  protect  vital  U.S.  security
interests against  threats  which may  arise  from  the  Soviet
Cuban  connection.  ~

It  is therefore  essential  that  the  American  people  understand
and  support  U.S.  policy.  This  will  require  that  official U.S.
statements  and  actions  avoid  generating  unrealizable  expectations
for  near-term progress  in  U.S.-Soviet  relations.  At  the  same
time,  the  U.S.  must  demonstrate· credibly  that  its policy  is not
a  blueprint  for  an  open-ended,  sterile confrontation with Moscow,
but  a  serious  search  for  a  stable  and  constructive  long-term
